## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background

Customer segmentation is a fundamental strategy in modern retail and marketing, enabling businesses to understand diverse customer needs and tailor their offerings accordingly. In the competitive retail landscape, particularly in mall environments, understanding customer behavior patterns becomes crucial for business success.

Traditional demographic segmentation often fails to capture the complexity of modern consumer behavior. Advanced analytics techniques, particularly unsupervised machine learning algorithms like clustering, offer powerful tools to discover hidden patterns in customer data and create more meaningful segments.

### 1.2 Business Problem

Mall retailers face several challenges:

- **Diverse customer base** with varying income levels, age groups, and spending behaviors
- **Limited marketing budgets** requiring targeted rather than broad-spectrum approaches
- **Need for personalization** in an increasingly competitive retail environment
- **Lack of clear customer segments** for strategic decision-making

### 1.3 Research Objectives

This study aims to:

1. **Compare the effectiveness** of K-means and Hierarchical clustering algorithms for customer segmentation
2. **Identify distinct customer segments** based on demographic and behavioral characteristics
3. **Develop actionable business insights** for targeted marketing strategies
4. **Validate clustering results** using statistical methods
5. **Provide recommendations** for implementation in retail settings

### 1.4 Dataset Overview

The analysis utilizes a mall customer dataset containing 200 customer records with the following attributes:

- **CustomerID**: Unique identifier
- **Gender**: Male/Female classification
- **Age**: Customer age (18-70 years)
- **Annual Income**: Income in thousands of dollars (15-137k range)
- **Spending Score**: Behavioral metric on 1-100 scale

## 2. Literature Review & Methodology

### 2.1 Clustering in Business Analytics

Clustering analysis has been extensively applied in customer segmentation research. Kumar et al. (2019) demonstrated the effectiveness of K-means clustering in retail customer segmentation, while Chen and Zhang (2020) highlighted the advantages of hierarchical methods for understanding customer relationship structures.

**K-means Clustering** is widely used due to its computational efficiency and interpretability. The algorithm partitions data into k clusters by minimizing within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS). Its effectiveness depends on proper selection of k and assumes spherical cluster shapes.

**Hierarchical Clustering** builds a tree of clusters, providing insights into customer relationship structures. It doesn't require pre-specifying the number of clusters and can reveal nested customer segments, though it's computationally more intensive.

### 2.2 Evaluation Metrics

#### 2.2.1 Internal Validation Metrics

**Silhouette Score** measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. Values range from -1 to 1, with higher values indicating better clustering.

**Davies-Bouldin Index** evaluates cluster separation and compactness. Lower values indicate better clustering quality.

**Calinski-Harabasz Index** measures the ratio between within-cluster and between-cluster dispersion. Higher values suggest better-defined clusters.

#### 2.2.2 Hierarchical-Specific Metrics

**Cophenetic Correlation** measures how well the hierarchical structure preserves original distances between data points. Values above 0.7 indicate excellent preservation.

### 2.3 Statistical Validation

Statistical tests validate whether identified clusters represent truly different groups:

- **ANOVA (F-test)** for comparing means across groups on continuous variables
- **Kruskal-Wallis test** as a non-parametric alternative when assumptions are violated
- **Chi-square tests** for examining associations between categorical variables and cluster membership

---

## 3. Data Analysis & Preprocessing

### 3.1 Data Quality Assessment

Initial data exploration revealed:

- **No missing values** across all 200 records
- **No duplicate entries** requiring removal
- **Balanced gender distribution** (Male: 112, Female: 88)
- **Normal to slightly skewed distributions** for all numeric variables

### 3.2 Descriptive Statistics

| Variable | Mean | Std Dev | Min | Max | Skewness |
|----------|------|---------|-----|-----|----------|
| Age | 38.85 | 13.97 | 18 | 70 | 0.49 |
| Annual Income (k$) | 60.56 | 26.26 | 15 | 137 | 0.32 |
| Spending Score | 50.20 | 25.82 | 1 | 99 | -0.05 |

**Key Observations:**

- Age distribution shows slight right skew but remains approximately normal
- Income distribution is well-balanced across the range
- Spending scores show near-perfect normal distribution
- All variables exhibit acceptable skewness levels (< 0.5)

### 3.3 Correlation Analysis

Correlation matrix revealed crucial insights for segmentation:

``` txt
                    Age    Income    Spending
Age                1.000   -0.012    -0.327
Annual Income     -0.012    1.000     0.010
Spending Score    -0.327    0.010     1.000
```

**Critical Finding:** Income and spending behavior show minimal correlation (r=0.010), creating ideal conditions for meaningful customer segmentation. This weak correlation enables identification of distinct customer types:

- High income + Low spending (conservative spenders)
- High income + High spending (premium customers)
- Low income + High spending (aspirational buyers)
- Low income + Low spending (budget-conscious)

### 3.4 Feature Engineering

To enhance clustering performance, three derived features were created:

**Income-to-Spend Ratio**: Calculated as Annual Income / (Spending Score + 1)

- Purpose: Identifies spending behavior relative to income capacity
- Range: 0.18 to 39.00 (mean: 2.29)
- High values indicate conservative spending; low values suggest generous spending

**Age Groups**: Categorical life-stage segmentation

- Young (<25): 35 customers (17.5%)
- Young Adult (25-34): 54 customers (27.0%)
- Middle Age (35-49): 66 customers (33.0%)
- Senior (50+): 45 customers (22.5%)

**Gender Encoding**: Binary encoding for algorithmic compatibility

- Female: 0, Male: 1
- Enables inclusion of gender patterns in clustering analysis

### 3.5 Data Standardization

StandardScaler transformation was applied to ensure equal feature contribution:

- **Before scaling**: Income (15-137k) dominated distance calculations
- **After scaling**: All features transformed to mean=0, standard deviation=1
- **Verification**: Scaled features range approximately [-3, +3] as expected

## 4. Clustering Methodology

### 4.1 K-means Clustering Analysis

#### 4.1.1 Optimal k Selection

K-means clustering was evaluated for k=2 through k=8 using multiple metrics:

| k | Silhouette | Davies-Bouldin | Calinski-Harabasz | Inertia |
|---|------------|----------------|-------------------|---------|
| 2 | 0.285 | 1.452 | 78.308 | 859.911 |
| 3 | 0.292 | 1.329 | 68.368 | 708.342 |
| 4 | 0.294 | 1.075 | 65.668 | 598.466 |
| 5 | 0.289 | 1.170 | 68.620 | 498.425 |
| 6 | 0.306 | 1.058 | 73.851 | 413.313 |
| 7 | 0.321 | 0.998 | 75.402 | 358.839 |
| 8 | 0.342 | 0.966 | 75.649 | 319.314 |

**Selection Rationale:**

- **k=8** achieved the highest silhouette score (0.342)
- **k=8** showed the lowest Davies-Bouldin index (0.966)
- Elbow method suggested k=4, but silhouette analysis favored k=8
- **Final decision: k=8** based on silhouette optimization

#### 4.1.2 Algorithm Configuration

- **n_init**: 10 (multiple random initializations for stability)
- **max_iter**: 300 (sufficient for convergence)
- **random_state**: 42 (reproducible results)

### 4.2 Hierarchical Clustering Analysis

#### 4.2.1 Linkage Method Comparison

Two linkage methods were evaluated:

**Ward Linkage:**

- Minimizes within-cluster variance at each merge
- Cophenetic correlation: 0.5264 (moderate preservation)
- Best for spherical, compact clusters

**Complete Linkage:**

- Uses maximum distance between cluster points
- Cophenetic correlation: 0.6787 (good preservation)
- Better preserves original distance relationships

**Selection: Complete linkage** based on superior cophenetic correlation.

#### 4.2.2 Optimal Cluster Number

Hierarchical clustering evaluation for 2-6 clusters:

| Clusters | Silhouette | Davies-Bouldin |
|----------|------------|----------------|
| 2 | 0.663 | 0.306 |
| 3 | 0.161 | 1.693 |
| 4 | 0.206 | 1.374 |
| 5 | 0.256 | 1.145 |
| 6 | 0.247 | 1.124 |

**Selection: 2 clusters** based on exceptional silhouette score (0.663).

### 4.3 Algorithm Comparison

| Method | Clusters | Silhouette | Davies-Bouldin | Strengths |
|--------|----------|------------|----------------|-----------|
| K-means | 8 | 0.342 | 0.966 | Detailed segmentation, computational efficiency |
| Hierarchical | 2 | 0.663 | 0.306 | Superior separation, relationship structure |

**Trade-off Analysis:**

- **Hierarchical clustering** shows superior statistical quality metrics
- **K-means clustering** provides more granular business segments
- Both approaches offer valuable but different perspectives on customer structure
